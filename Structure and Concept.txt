🧠 Advanced Ideas (when you're ready):

Add Chart.js integration to visualize monthly expenses

Create a date filter (e.g., “This Month”, “Last 30 days”)

Add authentication (mock or Firebase) to sync across devices

Store data on a Node.js server and fetch via API






"Create a personal budget tracker dashboard for desktop and mobile. The UI should include:

A clean header with the title 'Budget Tracker'

A form to add new transactions with fields: Category, Amount, Date, and Type (Income or Expense)

A summary section showing Total Income, Total Expenses, and Balance

A transaction history list showing each transaction with date, category, amount, and type

Buttons for exporting and importing JSON files

Use modern flat design with clear color distinction between income (green) and expenses (red)

Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Optional: Add a simple chart or graph placeholder for future data visualization"
